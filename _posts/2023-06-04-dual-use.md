Stage opens to VC1 and VC2 sitting at a sleek modern table, looking at a futuristic device in the center.

**Narrator**: "In the land of venture capital, two titans clash over a revolutionary invention."
**VC1** (Picks up the device, inspecting it): "This could be the next big commercial product." 
**VC2**: "Or the next big military breakthrough." 
**Inventor** (Skeptical): "It was designed for neither."

---

VC1 and VC2 ignore the Inventor, start arguing.

**VC1**: "Can't you see the commercial potential? It could change the way people live their lives." 
**VC2**: "And I see the military might. It could change the way wars are fought."
**Narrator**: "So deep in their clash of wills, they confused the nature and character of conflict."

---

VC1 and VC2 try to convince the Inventor.

**VC1**: "We can market this, create a demand. People will pay anything for the latest technology."
**VC2**: "And the military will pay even more. They need the latest technology to stay ahead."
**Inventor** (Frustrated): "You don't understand. It's not about who can use it, it's about what it was designed to do!"

---

VC1 and VC2 continue to ignore the Inventor, each trying to push their vision.

**VC1**: "We can revolutionize the consumer market!"
**VC2**: "We can revolutionize warfare!"
**Narrator** (Smiling wryly): "And thus, their battle raged on, driven by rational thought, chance, and a touch of violence."

---

VC1 and VC2 continue to argue, the Inventor leaves the stage. Returns with an object, places it on the table.

**Inventor**: "This... (points to the new object)...was a commercial success, and now is a military staple." 

(VC1 and VC2 look at the object, it's a simple can opener)

**Narrator**: "A simple tool, designed to open cans, found its dual use in warfare as it evolved. But it was not designed for war, it was designed to fulfill a need."

---

VC1 and VC2 look at the can opener, then the futuristic device, silent.

**Inventor** (Smiles): "Remember, gentlemen, you can't design something for war unless it addresses the fundamental nature of conflict." 
**Narrator**: "And so, the lesson was learned. In the world of innovation, the nature of conflict remains unchanged, while its character adapts with time."

(The stage darkens, leaving only the can opener and the futuristic device illuminated)

**Narrator** (Voice fading): "The immutable nature of conflict... and the ever-evolving character of war."
