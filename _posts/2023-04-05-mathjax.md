# Using MathJax with GitHub Pages and Jekyll

This post will show you how to use MathJax, a JavaScript library for rendering mathematical notation, with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

Some themes are natively supported by GitHub, such as the minima theme. However, the files for these themes cannot be modified directly. To circumvent this, we will copy the necessary files into our repository and modify them there.

## 1. Creating the `_includes` Directory

Create an `_includes` directory in your repository. When Jekyll builds your site, it will prioritize files in your repository's `_includes` folder over the ones in the theme.

## 2. Adding MathJax Support

Next, create a file named `mathjax_support.html` inside the `_includes` directory. This file will hold the necessary MathJax configuration script. Paste the following HTML code into `mathjax_support.html`:

```html
    <script>
        MathJax = {
            tex: {
                inlineMath: [['$', '$']]
            }
        };
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
    </script>
```

This script configures MathJax to recognize inline math between dollar signs (`$`), and loads the MathJax library from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

## 3. Creating a Custom Header

Next, create a file named `custom-head.html` in the `_includes` directory. This file will include the MathJax script in pages where MathJax is required. Paste the following HTML code into `custom-head.html`:

```
    {% raw %}
    {% if page.use_math %}  
    {% include mathjax_support.html %}  
    {% endif %}
    {% endraw %}
```

This code checks if the `use_math` variable is set to `true` in the front matter of the page. If it is, then it includes the MathJax support script.

## 4. Configuring Jekyll to Use MathJax

Add the following lines to your `_config.yml` file:

```yml
    kramdown:
        math_engine: mathjax
```

This tells Jekyll's Markdown processor, Kramdown, to use MathJax as its math rendering engine.

## 5. Enabling MathJax in a Post

To enable MathJax in a post or page, add `use_math: true` to the YAML front matter at the top of the file. When `use_math` is set to `true`, the `custom-head.html` file includes the MathJax support script, enabling MathJax rendering in that post.

# Examples:
$$
K(a,b) = \int \mathcal{D}x(t) \exp(2\pi i S[x]/\hbar)
$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
