This is a project based on the [FED Watch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html).

The motivation for this project is to develop an understanding to build a similar tool for the Bank of England.

# Background
The tool is built around the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the concept of Interest Rates Futures. In the context of this project the EMH suggests that the prices of Fed Funds futures already incorpoarate all known information about future changes in the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR). Therefore by analysing these prices, the market'e expectations about future chagnes in the EFFR can be infreref.

Interest Rate Futures are derivative contracts with an interest-bearing instrument as the underlying asset. The Fed Funds futures contracts are a type of interest rate futures which are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The price of these contracts reflects the market's expectations of the average daily EFFR for a given future month. Therefore, by analyzing the prices of these contracts, we can calculate the probabilities of different outcomes for the FOMC meetings.

According to the CME the Federal funds Rates is on of the most influential interest rates in the US. In order to hedge against potential short term changes in interest rates the markte turns to the 30 Day Federal Funds Futures Contracts. These contracts are listed monthly and are listed at 100 minus the expected Federal Funds Rate.
